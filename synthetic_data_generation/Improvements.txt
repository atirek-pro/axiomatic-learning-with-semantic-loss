Key Improvements Made:

1. Better Architecture

Modular design: Separated concerns into GraphGenerator, CausalReasoner, DataValidator, and AxiomaticDataGenerator

Configuration system: All parameters centralized in GenerationConfig dataclass

Type hints: Complete type annotations throughout

Error handling: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with proper logging

2. Fixed D-Separation Algorithm

Proper implementation: Uses correct d-separation rules with colliders, chains, and forks

Efficient path finding: Uses BFS for undirected path discovery

Accurate blocking logic: Correctly handles conditioning sets and descendant checking

3. Improved Graph Generation

Guaranteed DAG property: Uses topological ordering to ensure valid DAGs

Better connectivity: Ensures all nodes are reachable

Proper density control: More predictable edge density

4. Data Validation

Automatic validation: Every generated example is validated for correctness

Premise parsing: Robust parsing of natural language premises

Logical consistency: Ensures labels match actual causal structure

5. Better Error Handling & Logging

Retry logic: Multiple attempts for generation with fallback

Progress tracking: Shows generation progress

Detailed logging: Comprehensive logging for debugging

6. Performance Improvements

Efficient algorithms: Better time complexity for path finding

Caching potential: Structure ready for caching frequently computed results

Memory management: Proper cleanup and resource management

7. Enhanced Robustness

Input validation: Validates all parameters before processing

Edge case handling: Handles degenerate cases gracefully

Failure recovery: Continues generation even if some examples fail

8. Better Code Quality

Documentation: Comprehensive docstrings for all methods

Consistent style: Follows Python conventions

Maintainability: Clean, readable code structure

The script now generates more reliable, validated data with proper causal reasoning logic. The d-separation implementation is mathematically correct, and the graph generation ensures valid DAG structures. All generated examples are automatically validated before inclusion in the dataset.
